# HR-Attrition-Analysis

**Introduction:**
This project aims to analyze employee turnover data and provide insights to inform talent retention strategies. Employee turnover is a significant challenge for organizations as it not only impacts productivity but also incurs costs associated with recruiting and training new employees. The analysis will help identify the factors contributing to employee turnover and provide recommendations to reduce turnover rates.

**Data:**
The data used for this analysis includes employee demographics, job roles, salaries, tenure, and other factors such as business travel frequency, distance from home to the office, and self-defined ethnicity. The data is collected from a range of sources and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. The data includes 5 tables in which date table is made using DAX.

**Analysis:**
The analysis is conducted using Power BI to identify correlations and trends between the various factors and employee turnover rates. The analysis includes descriptive analysis to determine the factors that are most strongly associated with turnover rates. The findings are then used to develop recommendations for talent retention strategies. There are total 1470 employees and 16.21% of the employees have left. The analysis also identifies other factors that contribute to employee turnover, such as business travel frequency and distance from home to the office. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to improve talent retention strategies, such as offering competitive salaries, benefits, and professional development opportunities.

**Results:**
The analysis reveals several key insights into employee turnover rates. For instance, employees who earn a higher salary have a lower turnover rate, suggesting that providing competitive salaries can help reduce turnover rates. Additionally, the analysis indicates that employees who work in the Sales and Technology department and earn less than the industry standard have a higher turnover rate, highlighting the importance of providing competitive salaries and benefits.
Furthermore, the analysis shows that employees who have tenure of 1 year have a higher turnover rate, emphasizing the need for positive interactions between staff and current manager. Males have worked overtime as well as are frequent travellers. This implies that in order to achieve gender equity and foster a more inclusive working culture, the firm may need to reassess its policies and procedures.

Overall, the analysis of employee turnover data provides critical insights that organizations can use to inform their talent retention strategies and reduce turnover rates, leading to increased productivity.
